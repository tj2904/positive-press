# Positive Press:  _Sorting Newsheadlines to find the postive_
![screenshot-trial-page-compressed](https://github.com/tj2904/positive-press/assets/3164936/56bf6169-55fd-44ae-a1a3-42188f7a05aa)

A web app that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyse news headlines and provide a curated feed of news ranked by positivity. This is the responsive frontend app, built in NextJS to demonstrate the utility of the APIs. 
There is an accompanying [repo](https://www.github.com/tj2904/pp-api) for the Python backend.

[Visit the app deployed on Vercel](https://positive-press.vercel.app/), or read a little more about it in my [Portfolio Entry](https://tj2904.com/positive-press).
